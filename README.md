<h1>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder... so is it Power or Disease?</h1>

This horror visual novel game plunges you into the torment of nature’s beauty. As a new student arriving at this gothic Academy of Pharmaceuticals and Botanical sciences, you’ll soon discover that the students are eerily obsessed with cutting open and finding the source of what truly allures us all.

Be careful of what catches your eyes for you may get hurt in the process...
